# Insider Threat detection lab with Splunk

This project shows a real world insider htreat senario in Splunk. It detects suspicious user actions such as data exfilteration Via email/USB, unauthorized file deletion, and unusual access patterns â€” all visualized through custom SPL queries and a dark-themed Splunk dashboard.

---
## Objectives

- Simulate internal threat with a custom audit log
- Detect exfiltration, deletion, and misuse of sensitive data
- Build SPL queries and visualise results in splunk
- Align detection with MITRE ATT&CK techniques

# Dashboard Panels 

- File Exfilteration Events- detects upload and email
- User Action Summary- Stats count by user, action
- Timeline of Events-Sorted_time for misuse analysis


# MITRE ATT&CK Mapping 

- USB/email exfiltrationc - Technique: Exfiltration over physical media, ID: T1052.001
